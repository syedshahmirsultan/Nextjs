The emphasis will be on hands-on learning by educating students to produce projects. To accommodate everyone, courses will be held primarily on weekends or after 6:00 p.m. (Pakistan Time) on weekdays. It employs a hybrid teaching format, with core onsite classes complemented by online Zoom laboratories and recorded videos.

<Heading className='heading4'>The Outcome for Participants of the Program</Heading>
<Text className='texts' as='p'>The graduates of this program will own products (Full-Stack App Templates, AR and VR Experiences, and APIs) that are marketed globally by the Panaverse DAO and, if they like, will also be able to start off by offering services at a rate of $50 per hour ($96,000 per year). This would give Pakistani professionals and students a fantastic opportunity to better their financial situation while also giving the economy a much-needed boost by expanding software exports.</Text>
